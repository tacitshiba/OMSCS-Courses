## **Software Design**

Software design is the process of building a program while satisfying a problem's functional requirements and not violating its non-functional constraints.

Software design is typically broken up into two phases:

1. **Architectural design**: the process of identifying and assigning the responsibility for aspects of behavior to various modules or components of a software
2. **Detail design**: the process of specifying the behavior of each of the system components that you've identified during architectural design

## **Design Notation**

“The primary activity during data design is to select logical representations of data objects identified during the requirements definition and specification phase. The selection process may involve algorithmic analysis of alternative structures in order to determine the most efficient design or may simply involve the use of a set of modules that provide the operations upon some representation of an object.”            - Wasserman

There are several of notations used in software design:

- **Pseudo code and PDL (program design language)**: keywords, free syntax of natural language, data declaration, subprogram, definition, and calling
- **Structured programming**: sequence, condition, repetition, chunking
- **Flowcharts and call graphs**: directed graphs - node is computational unit; arc is flow of control
- **Decision tables**: rules, conditions, actions

## Approaches To Software Design

A **method** is a systematic sequence of steps that a design team uses to solve a problem.

All approaches to design include three aspects that may be compared, the design method, the design representation, and how that design is going to be validated.

## Issues With Design

There are many issues with design however, one important aspect is the tension between long-term maintainability and short-term schedule.

## Design Validation

Below are some issues with design validation:

- Independence of validators
- Dependence on design method
- On-going versus after-the-fact

## Other Design Issues

Here are some other design issues:

- Architectural versus detail design
- Functional behavior versus non-functional constraints
- Specification/what versus design/how
- Application specificity

## Traditional Design Documentation

Traditional design documentation might include:

- Sub-components:
    - Processes/activities
    - Data/data flows
- Control flow: control regime
- Performance
- Resources

## Leonardo Objects

Below are some examples of Leonardo objects:

- **Stakeholders**: views/interests and work procedures
- **Issue bases**: issues, alternatives, analyses, resolutions (commitments, decisions), rationale, impacts, conflicts
- **Temporal relations**: histories, schedules, transformations, versions (revisions, releases, variants)
- **Constraints**: internal, external (requirements, specifications)
- **Aggregates**: configurations, packages, components

## Design Rationale

Design decisions are explicit choices of how to trade off two non-functional aspects of a design, such as speed versus size.

Rationale **根本原因，逻辑依据**

Design decisions are explicit choices of how to trade off two non-functional aspects of a design, such as speed versus size.

## Coupling And Cohesion

Conceptual Integrity

- **Coupling** is the extent to which two components depend on each other for successful execution. Generally, low coupling is good
- **Cohesion** is the extent to which a component has a single purpose or function. In general, high cohesion is good

## Abstraction And Refinement

Below are some abstraction mechanisms:

- **Declarative**: what, not how
- **Aggregation**: container, not contents (聚合)G
- **Generalization**: class, not individuals
- **Parameterization**: bind details later
- **Non-determinism**: leaving choices unspecified

## Design Philosophy

Some design philosophies from philosophers include:

- Descartes - analysis and use of models
- Marx - understanding of the social context of design solutions and user-centered design
- Heidegger - tools for accomplishing goals, e.g., CASE, IDE
- Wittgenstein - language games desktop metaphor

## Summary

Design is the most creative part of software development.

## Section Quizzes

### Terms Quiz

*Can you distinguish the following definitions*?

- Design: deliberative, purposive planning
- Engineering: skillful or artful contrivance applying scientific and mathematical principles
- Craft: skilled occupation
- Art: use of skill, taste, and imagination in the production of aesthetic objects

### Programming Or Design Quiz

*Which of the following are differences between software design and programming*?

- Scale
- Emphasis on non-functional requirements

### Weather Quiz

*If you were designing for performance, would you use an array or a collection of interdependent objects to hold data about weather for a region*?

We would use an array.

### Design Review Quiz

*What are the negative consequences of testing a design for the first time once the project has been completed*?

That would not be cost or time effective.

### Documentation Quiz

*Pick an organization that would require formal documentation*:

A military contractor would require formal documentation.

### Java Quiz 1

*Which of (reduced) coupling or (increased) cohesion do Java packages support*?

Java packages support reduced coupling.

### Java Quiz 2

*Does the Java class inheritance mechanism increase or decrease coupling between the parent and child classes*?

The Java class inheritance mechanism increases coupling.

### Metaphors Quiz

*Can you think of any other metaphors we use when talking about computers*?

It was interesting to realize that engineers set the *on* function as a *1* and the *off* function as a *0* and kept what is mostly a backend attribute on the front of products when they shipped.
